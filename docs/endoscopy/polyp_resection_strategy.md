|     Lesion type                                                          |     Lesion size    |     Strategy                                                                                                                                                 |

|     SSL with dysplastic nodule                                           |     Up to 2cm      |     Lift, hot snare EMR, cut current (i.e. treat as for adenoma)                                                                                             |
|     SSL with dysplastic nodule                                           |     >2cm           |     Refer to complex polyp MDT for resection on EMR list. Only tattoo if   very subtle lesion                                                                |
|     Pedunculated adenoma                                                 |     Any size       |     Hot snare, coagulation current. Consider pre-injection of stalk with   adrenaline for large stalks. Consider clipping of stalk post resection            |
|     Sessile adenoma with regular surface pattern                         |     1cm or less    |     Cold snare with good margin of normal tissue. Cold snaring and   confirmation of full clearance is easiest after lifting                                 |
|     Sessile adenoma with regular surface pattern and good access         |     1-2cm          |     Lift, hot snare EMR, cut current. Snare tip soft coagulation not   generally needed for lesions less than 2cm as there is no evidence base for   this    |
|     Sessile adenoma with regular surface pattern                         |     >2cm           |     Refer to complex polyp MDT for resection on EMR list. No requirement   to tattoo as these lesions will not be missed                                     |
|     Sessile adenoma with poor access                                     |     Any size       |     Refer to complex polyp MDT for discussion. Consider tattoo if lesion   difficult to find                                                                 |
|     Sessile adenoma with areas of irregular or absent surface pattern    |     Any size       |     Biopsy irregular surface areas, tattoo in case resection required,   refer to complex polyp MDT for discussion                                           |
|     Recurrent adenoma in previous resection site                         |     Any size       |     Refer to complex polyp MDT for discussion                                                                                                                |
