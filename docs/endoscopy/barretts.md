## Diagnosis

- &gt;1cm length from GOJ of confirmed intestinal metaplasia on biopsy
- High definition endoscopy (other modalities not advised)
- Random 4 quadrant biopsies every 2cm

## General Flowchart

>ESGE Position:
>
>- &lt;1cm - no surveillance

- 1-3cm - 5 years
- 3-10cm - 3 years
- &gt;10cm - Barrett's centre
- No surveillance if age&gt;75

Indefinite for dysplasia requires 6-month follow-up. 6â€…months for LGD. If LGD is also found at follow-up endoscopy, even if not consecutive, provided that the diagnosis of dysplasia on two occasions is confirmed by two independent GI pathologists (ideally from a different institution), endoscopic ablation should be considered. HGD also needs to be confirmed by a second GI pathologist.

>Consensus diagnosis of LGD by independent pathologists correlates with a significant risk of progression to HGD/cancer and RFA significantly reduces this risk. (3)

## Treatment

- Prophylactic endotherapy for non-dysplasia not advised (0.3% risk of progression to cancer/year)
- Indefinite for dysplasia - repeat in 6 months, if repeat has not dysplasia no surveillance
- Low grade dysplasia - repeat in 6 months, if LGD at repeat for RFA; if no LGD repeat in 6 months and if ok resume as above
- High grade dysplasia - RFA
- T1a adenocarcinoma - EMR

> Note: NICE guidelines are being updated as of 2018
