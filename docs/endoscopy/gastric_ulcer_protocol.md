## Initial Endoscopy

When a gastric ulcer is found on initial endoscopy it is essential that:

1. A description of the ulcer is provided in the report including if it looks benign or malignant, an estimate of the ulcer size and its location
2. All gastric ulcers should be biopsied (at least x6). If there is concern that biopsy could provoke any bleeding (e.g. in inpatient bleeders), a repeat OGD for biopsies should be scheduled ideally prior to discharge
3. A CLO test is taken
4. A malignancy risk score is calculated (see table below)

On receiving the biopsy results:

1. If the histology it not concerning for malignancy/dysplasia there is no need to arrange a follow-up endoscopy providing:

- The ulcer appeared benign macroscopically
- Any symptoms settle
- There is no concern about rarer causes of ulceration such as gastric Crohnâ€™s
- The ulcer risk score is <3

2. If there were concerning macroscopic appearances with benign appearing biopsies an 8 week repeat OGD should be arranged.

Ulcer risk score calculation:

An ulcer risk score of <3 has an NPV 97.4% without taking into account if the ulcer appears benign or not. It is considered an extra layer of safety to ensure malignancies are not missed despite the apparent 100% NPV of the combination of benign macroscopic and benign microscopic appearances.
