4. [AIMS65](https://www.mdcalc.com/aims65-score-upper-gi-bleeding-mortality)

## Rockall Score

- Pre-endoscopic score (ignore last 2 rows in figure below) of 0 considered low risk
- Completed scores of &lt;2 considered low risk

Completed scores and outcomes:

| Score | Rebleed Rate | Mortality Rate |
| ------| ------ | ------- |
| 0 | 4.9% | 0% |
|1 | 3.4% | 0% |
|2 | 5.3% | 0.2% |
|3 | 11.2% | 2.9% |
|4 | 14.1% | 5.3% |
|5 | 24.1% | 10.8% |
|6 | 32.9% | 17.3% |
|7 | 43.8% | 27% |
|8 or more | 41.8% | 41.1%|

## Glasgow Blatchford Score

- Modeled on Glasgow population in 1997
- Pre-endoscopy scoring system
- Scores of 0-1 low risk of intervention
- Helps predict who can be safely managed as outpatient
- Coffee ground vomiting not used in score (not a good predictor)
- Not validated for inpatient use
- Score &gt;0 do not imply need for admission

## AIMS65

- Simpler scoring method
- Max score 5
- 2 or more is high risk
- Low AIMS65 not validated for discharge
- Used to predict mortality only; correlation to rebleeding rates, endoscopic findings unknown

| Risk Factor | Score |
| ------- | ------- |
| Albumin &lt;30g/L | 1 |
| INR &gt;1.5 | 1 |
| Altered Mental Status | 1 |
| SBP &lt;90 | 1 |
| Age &gt;65 | 1 |

## Comparing Scores

- Comparison shows GBS to be more accurate at predicting intervention or death compared to AIMS65 or Rockall (AUROC of 0.86 vs 0.66 for Rockall and 0.68 for AIMS65)(2)
