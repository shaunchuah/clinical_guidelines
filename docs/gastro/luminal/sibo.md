# Small Intestinal Bacterial Overgrowth

Date: 25-10-2019

## Diagnosis

- Not straightforward
- Low B12, raised red cell folate are clues
- May have slightly raised CRP
- Often co-existent with other GI diseases eg. IBD

## Diagnostic tests

- Culture of small bowel aspirate from endoscopy
- Alternative is hydrogen breath testing following carbohydrate load (hydrogen and methane are not produced by human cells), poor sensitivity and specificity

## Treatment

- Sometimes treated empirically due to limited availability of tests
- 1-2 weeks of antibiotics eg rifaximin, vancomycin (gut-selective)
- Limited evidence
