# Coeliac Disease

Date: 23-10-2019

## Genetics

- Very strong association with HLA-DQ2.5 (>90% of CD patients). DR3, DQ2 positivity
- Remainder are HLA-DQ8

## Diagnosis

- Serology: anti-TTG IgA
- Biopsy remains gold standard as not all serology kits are reliable
- 2% of patients are IgA deficient
- HLA testing has high negative predictive value in unclear cases
- Vilous atrophy may be patchy therefore at least four biopsies recommended

## Pathology

- Increased intraepithelial lymphotcytes, crypt hyperplasia, villous atrophy
- Marsh classification
- Note villous atrophy is not specific for coeliac

Pathology report:

- Number of biopsies
- Architecture: Normal, partial, subtotal or total villous atrophy
- Lamina propria features: lymphocytes, plasma cells, eosinophils
- Presence of Brunner's glands
- Crypt hyperplasia
- Villous height:crypt depth ratio (3:1)
- Evaluation of intraepithelial lymphocytes

### Differential diagnoses of lymphocytic duodenosis and villous atrophy

- Infection eg H. Pylori, CVID, drugs, neoplasia

## Extra-Intestinal Manifestations

- Dermatitis herpetiformis (diagnosed by IgA in perilesional skin, rx dapsone)

## Follow-up

- Annual FBC, LFTs, folate/B12, ferritin, TFTs, anti-tTG
- Assess tTG at 1 year - should normalise if sticking to gluten-free diet
- Need for long-term follow-up is controversial
- Increased risk of OP - check Ca, ALP, vit D - DEXA in patients after 1 year of GFD if over age of 55 or additional risk factors of OP
- Can get functional hyposplenism - pneumococcal, haemophilus, meningococcus and influenza vaccinations
- If non-adherent - review with dietician

## Non-responsive CD

- Review diagnosis
- Review adherence
- If adherent consider repeat OGD, colonoscopy, elastase and TFTs, small bowel imaging

## Refractory CD

- Defined as persistent or recurrent malabsorptive despite a strict GFD for more than 12 months in the absence of other causes of villous atrophy or malignant complications
- Type 1 - Monoclonal T cells
- Treatment in type 1 - no standard Rx, steroids, budesonide, azathioprine, elemental diets used
- Type 2 - Aberrant T cells (Loss of CD3/CD8) - poorer prognosis, increased risk of transformation to EATL
- Ulcerative jejunoileitis should raise suspicion for lymphoma

## Malignancy

- EATL - Rare lymphoma associated with RCD2, 5 year survival <20%
- Association with B cell lymphoma and small intestinal adenocarcinoma
