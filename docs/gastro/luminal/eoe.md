# Eosinophilic Oesophagitis

Date: 25-10-2019

## Introduction

EOE was first recognised in the late 1970s. Main cause of dysphagia and food bolus in children and young adults.

## Definition

Chronic, local immune-mediated oesophageal disease with symptoms of oesophageal dysfunction and eosinophil-predominant inflammation following exclusion of other causes of eosinophilia.

(PPI-responsive oesophageal eosinophilia now dropped from definition - PPI therapy no longer criteria for EOE diagnosis)

Patients achieving remission on PPI are part of the EOE continuum.

## Epidemiology

- Incidence: 1-20 per 100 000 population
- Prevalence: 13-49 per 100 000 population
- 23-50% of patients with dysphagia and food bolus
- Male gender strong risk factor
- Peak age 30-50 years old
- Association with rhinitis, asthma, eczema (remains unproven that atopy increases risk of EOE)

## Diagnosis

- At least 6 biopsies from different locations
- Greater than 15 eosinophils per high power field

## Treatment

- PPI eg omeprazole 20-40mg BD - 50% histologic remission (<15 eosinophils pHPF); if responds recommend long-term (70-80% maintain remission at 1 year)
- Topical steroids (side effect 10-15% candidiasis) - Swallowed fluticaasone (2 puffs QDS) previously, now oral budesonide viscous 1mg BD
- Allergy testing of little utility
- Dilatation is generally safe (perforation rate 0.3%), post-procedure chest pain in approx 75%
- Systemic steroids NOT recommended

## Follow-up

- Endoscopy 6-12 weeks post treatment is recommended
