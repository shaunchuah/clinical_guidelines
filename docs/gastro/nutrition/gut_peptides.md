# Gut Peptides

Date: 29-10-2019

## Ghrelin

- Produced by enteroendocrine cells in the oxyntic glands of the stomach and upper intestine
- Ligand for the growth hormone stimulatory receptor (GHS-R)
- Rises before meals and falls rapidly when food is eaten (High levels in fasting states)
- Ghrelin stimulates food intake
- Crosses blood brain barrier

## Gastrin

- Produced by G cells in antrum, duodenum and pancreas
- Released when food enters the stomach
- Stimulates release of acid by parietal cells
- Stimulates release of pepsinogen by chief cells
- Induces pancreatic secretions and gallbladder emptying

!!! info
    Pathological in Zollinger-Ellison syndrome (gastrinoma usually of the duodenum or pancreas)

!!! tip
    Levels increased by PPI use and autoimmune gastritis (can be used to check compliance)

## Secretin

- Produced by S cells in duodenum
- Regulates pH of duodenum by inhibiting parietal cells and stimulating bicarbonate from ductal cells of pancreas
- Stimulates bile production
- Role in water regulation

## Vasoactive Intestinal Peptide

- Produced by many tissues - gut, pancreas, brain
- Induces smooth muscle relaxation (LES, stomach, gallbladder)
- Stimulates water and electrolyte secretion in small intestine
- Similar role to secretin - inhibits gastric acid, stimulate bicarbonate
- Also found in the heart - coronary vasodilatation, positive ionotropic and chronotropic effect

### VIPoma

- 90% originate from non-islet cells of pancreas, incidence 1 in 10 million/year
- Associated with MEN1 syndrome, 50-75% malignant at presentation
- Symptoms: Profound watery and chronic diarrhoea with low K, low Cl, acidosis, flushing, hypotension, high Ca (VIP stimulates bone resorption), high glucose (VIP stimulates glycogenolysis), lethagy, muscle weakness, nausea, vomiting, crampy abdominal pain
- Diagnosis: Measure VIP levels, CT, MRI, somatostatin receptor scintigraphy
- Management: Octreotide blocks action of VIP, manages symptoms; Surgery if possible, alternative is peptide receptor radionuclide therapy (attach radionuclide to octreotide)

## CCK

- Produced by I cells in upper intestine
- Slows gastric emptying, mediates intestinal motility
- Stimulates pancreatic and gallbladder secretions
- Levels rise rapidly when food enters intestine within 15 minutes
- Falls with meal termination
- Exogenous CCK inhibits food intake by reducing meal size and duration

## Glucagon and Amylin

- Similar levels profile to CCK
- Amylin centrally mediated
- Glucagon peripherally mediated in the liver

## Pancreatic Polypeptide

- Islet of Langerhans
- Reduces food intake via Y4 receptor in brainstem and hypothalamus
- PP levels rise in response to food intake

## GLP-1

- Produced by L cells in distal intestine (co-secreted with peptide YY)
- Slower time profile - lasting several hours after a meal
- Inhibits food intake - reduces food size, increases satiety ratio (but limited effect due to quick degradation by DPP4)
- Stimulates insulin release
- Continous analogues resistant to DPP4 degradation lead to reduced appetite, body weight and improved glycaemic control

## Peptide YY

- Produced by L cells in distal intestine
- Slower time profile - lasting several hours after a meal
- Two forms - PYY 1-36 and PYY 3-36

## Leptin

- Levels rise with increased amount of adipose tissue
- Secreted by adipocytes
- Diurnal variation of levels, peaks at night
- Resistance to leptin in obese subjects
