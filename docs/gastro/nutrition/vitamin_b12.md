# Vitamin B12 Metabolism

- Water soluble vitamin
- Important cofactor for DNA synthesis - red cell and neurological function
- Only produced by certain bacteria and archaea (single-cell organisms)

## Absorption Pathway

- First binds to haptocorrin (from salivary glands, protects B12 from acid degradation)
- Intrinsic factor from parietal cells in stomach and bound B12 enter duodenum
- Pancreatic proteases free B12 from haptocorrin and allow binding to IF
- Absorbed in terminal ileum
- Released from IF and binds to transcobalamin
- Stored in the liver

!!! info
    Some B12 is filtered out by the kidney and recovered in the renal tubules by megalin

## Daily requirements

Adults: 2.4mcg/day
Pregnant: 2.6mcg/day

## Pernicious Anaemia

- Autoimmune atrophic gastritis
- Cause for 20-50% of B12 deficiency
- Anti-IF and anti-GPC antibodies (combined performance 73% sensitivity 100% specificity)
- Associated with autoimmune thyroid disease (40%), T1DM (5-10%)
- Onset is usually slow and insidious
- Symptoms relating to anaemia, neurological symptoms much rarer
- Differential diagnoses: dietary deficiency, other disorders impairing absorption eg Crohn's, post-surgery
- Increased risk of gastric adenocarcinoma (annual incidence 0.1-0.5%)

## Trivia

- B12 is produced industrially by fermentation of certain strains of bacteria
- 4 companies produce the world's supply
