# Gastroenterology Notes

These notes were created as part of my revision for the ESEGH exams. The information here is targeted to professionals and assumes a post-MRCP baseline level of knowledge.

Please note the information was last updated in 2019 and while I will update this as time allows, I make no guarantees that this information is fully up-to-date at all times. This information should not be solely relied upon for medical decision-making as the gastroenterology field evolves rapidly.

I hope you find this resource useful. All the best!

!!! note
    Topics were chosen based on questions I answered incorrectly when revising.
