# Pregnancy-Related Liver Disease

Date: 30-10-2019

- Around 3% of pregnancies are complicated by some form of liver disease
- Physiological changes in pregnancy: Raised ALP in 3rd trimester, lower albumin, spider naevi, palmar erythema, reduced gallbladder motility (increased risk of gallstones)

Pregnancy and liver disease can be divided into 3 subclasses:

1. Pregnancy-related liver disease
2. Non-pregnancy related liver disease eg. hepatitis etc.
3. Pre-existing chronic liver disease

## Early

### Hyperemesis Gravidarum

- Intractable nausea and vomiting
- Usually 9-20 weeks
- Assoc with abnormal LFTs in approx 50%
- Complicates 0.3-2% of pregnancies
- Aim to rule out other causes of deranged LFTs

## Late

### Intrahepatic Cholestasis of Pregnancy

- Abnormal biliary transport over cannalicular membrane (multifactorial cause)
- Late 2nd to 3rd trimester and resolves within 4 weeks of delivery
- Main symptom is pruritus
- Other symptoms: malabsorption, steatorrhoea, jaundice
- Measure serum bile acid levels - &gt;40micromols correlated with adverse outcomes
- Rx UDCA 15mg/kg/day; rifampicin 2nd line
- 40-70% recurrence in subsequent pregnancies
- If derangement persists beyond 3 months post-delivery should be further investigated
- Generally benign for mother but may be associated with poor perinatal outcomes for the foetus

### Acute Fatty Liver of Pregnancy

- Microvesicular fatty infiltration of hepatocytes
- Medical and obstetric emergency as is associated with mortality
- 3rd trimester
- 1 in 7000 to 1 in 16000 pregnancies
- ?related to mitochondrial dysfunction
- Initial presentation non-specific but can progress rapidly to acute liver failure
- Deranged LFTs usually 300-500 for aminotransferases and raised bilirubin
- Hypoglycaemia is characteristic and carries a poor prognosis
- DIC in 10%
- Diagnosis based on clinical, lab findings, Swansea criteria and exclusion of other liver diseases
- Main differential is HELLP syndrome (signs of liver failure more common in AFLP)
- Rx early delivery and supportive care

### HELLP Syndrome/Pre-Eclampsia

- HELLP is variant of severe pre-eclampsia (12%)
- Haemolysis, elevated liver enzymes and low platelets
- Usually presents with abdominal pain, nausea/vomiting, hypertension, proteinuria
- DIC can be seen in severe cases
- Histopath changes: periportal haemorrhage, hepatocyte necrosis, sinusoidal fibrin deposition
- Rx: Delivery
