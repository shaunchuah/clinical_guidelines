# Gallbladder Polyps in PSC

Date: 26-10-2019

- Gallbladder polyps in PSC have increased malignant potential compared to non-PSC patients
- Various studies show that between 14-50% of resected polyps are malignant (quality of evidence low)
- BSG 2019 guidelines suggests annual USS and polyps should be referred to HPB MDT (strength of recommendation weak, quality of evidence low)
- EASL and AASLD recommend resection of gallbladder polyps in PSC regardless of size (this is controversial - ESGAR, EAES, ESGE, EFISDS don't agree)
